# HO2: XR in Unity

## Objectives
- Install the [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@3.0/manual/index.html) in a Unity project
- Play your VR game through the `XR Device Simulator`
- Set up your headset
- Build and upload your game to your headset

## Set up a project for VR
Unity provides the [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@3.0/manual/index.html) to help programmers making XR games, specifically VR games in our case.

**If you have any questions, remember to check the online documentation first.**

To install the toolkit in a new project, follow these steps:

### Create a Unity Project
First, create a new **Unity 6** project using the **3D (Built-In Renderer Pipeline)** template  

_Note: Quest 1 has been end of life for a while now, Unity support for it is greatly reduced. From our experience, there are some compatibility issues with the `Universal Renderer Pipeline` (`URP`). It is possible to use it but highly instable. If you are given a Quest 1, we highly recommend that you only use the basic features of URP. No such issues should occur on Quest 2._ 

### Install the required packages
Then, install the required **packages** (`Window > Package Manager > Unity Registry > <package_name> > Install`)
- **`Universal RP`**
- **`XR Interaction Toolkit`**  
  Install the **`XR Device Simulator`** and **`Starter Assets`** samples as well (`Window > Package Manager > In Project > XR Interaction Toolkit > Samples`)
- **`XR Plugin Management`**
- **`OpenXR Plugin`**

To make sure every package is correctly installed, go to `Window > Package Manager > In Project` and make sure each of them appear in the list:
![`Package Manager > In Project`](./figures/package_manager.png)

### Set up settings
- Enable **`OpenXR` Plug-in Provider** (`Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management`, tick `OpenXR` under each tab)
- Enable `OpenXR` **`Meta Quest Support`** 
  - `Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR > (android tab) > OpenXR Feature Groups`, tick `Meta Quest Support`
  - Select the correct **target device** (Quest or Quest 2) `Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR > OpenXR Feature Groups > Meta Quest Support`, click on the cog and tick the correct device under `Target Devices`
- Enable the **`Oculus Touch Controller Profile`** (`Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR > Enabled Interactions Profiles > + > Oculus Touch Controller Profile`, for each tab)
- **Fix all issues** under **Project Validation** (`Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > Project Validation > Fix all`, for each tab)
- Switch the **build platform** to **Android** (`File > Build Profiles > Platforms > Android > Switch Platform`)
- Change the active input system to the newest system (`Project Settings > Player > Active Input Handling > Input System Package (New)`)

![`Project Settings > XR Plug-In Management > OpenXR`](./figures/project_settings.png)

You will find a [concise version of this tutorial (`unity_setup.md`)](../resources/unity_setup.md) in the `resources` folder.

## Play the demo on your computer
Play the **`DemoScene`** (`Assets > Samples > XR Interaction Toolkit > {version} > Starter Assets > DemoScene`) on your computer using the **`XR Device Simulator`**. To enable the XR Device Simulator, tick: `Edit > Project settings > XR Plug-in Management > XR Interaction Toolkit > Use XR Device Simulator in scenes`

## Set up your headset (one per team)
The headset you received have been pre-configured to enable developer mode (to upload private apps manually). We recommend installing the Meta Quest Developer Hub to ease up the process of uploading a game to the headset.

- Make sure you correctly installed the **Meta Quest Developer Hub** (see [HO1](./ho1.md) for instructions). Open it
- Connect your headset to your computer via USB-C  
  In the headset, you will be prompted to allow connections coming from this computer. Allow them.
- _If your local machine runs on Windows, you can use [Link](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/connect-with-air-link/) to avoid building your game every time you want to test it. However, we will not provide any support._

You should now see a screen similar to this one: 

![MQDH Headset Active Screen](./figures/mqdh_headset_active.png)

_Remember the **`Apps`** panel. This is where you'll upload your game._

## Build your game
**Build** the **`.apk`** file of your application to upload it on your headset:

- Make sure all **issues are fixed** under `Edit > Project Settings > XR Plugin Management > Project validation`
- Make sure the build **target platform** is set to **Android** (`File > Build Profiles > Platforms/Android`)
- Make sure the scene you want to build is in your **build scene list**: `File > Build Profiles > Platforms/Android > Scene List`. Add the **`DemoScene`** in the list and remove any other scenes.
- Click on **`Build`** to create the **`.apk`** file of your game  
  _Tip: Save all your builds under `Assets > Builds` for a cleaner project structure_  
  _Note: Optionally, you can use `Build And Run` to directly upload to your headset if connected._  

A popup indicating "Unsupported Input Handling" may appear. Click `No` and set `Edit > Project Settings > Player > Active Input Handling > Input System Package (New)`. This will restart your editor.

## Upload your game to the headset 
Now, you need to upload the **`.apk`** file to the headset.

- Open **`Meta Quest Developer Hub`**
- Connect your headset to your computer via USB-C
  - In the headset, you will be prompted to allow connections coming from this computer. Allow them.
- Drag and drop your **`.apk`** file to the dedicated area
- Then click on the three dots and **`Launch app`**. Your app should launch directly in the headset.
